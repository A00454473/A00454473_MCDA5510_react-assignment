      <h1>Hi, I'm Rishan</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a Software Engineer and Data Analyst currently pursuing <br/>
        Master of Science in Computing and Data Analytics at Saint Mary's University, NS, Canada.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        I have brief experiences in both Software and Data and want to further my knowledge on
        how I can leverage the power of both domains to solve real-world problems which led me to choose the MCDA program.
